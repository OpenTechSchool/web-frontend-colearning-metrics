# Web Frontend Co-Learning Metrics

We provide some data here that we collected over the past years while running the Web Frontend Co-Learning, so you can use it to experiment and try something cool.

Do you want to learn a new library? Or try out the latest framework?
Why not play with data visualization?
Feel free to use the data we provide here.

You can then publish your demo on this repo, if you fancy to do it.
To do so, just copy the ots-template folder (under `web-frontend-colearning-metrics/pages/ots-template/`),
update `index.html` with your code.
`main.js` can be completely replaced with your own JavaScript code.
You will need to keep `utilities.js` as it is and call it in your `index.html`.
