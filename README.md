# Web Frontend Co-Learning Metrics

We provide here some data we collect over the past years while running the frontend co-learning, so you can use them to experiment and try something cool.

Do you want to learn a new library? Or try out the last framework?
Why not play with data visualization?
Feel free to use the data we provide here.

You can then public your demo on this repo, if you fancy do it.
To do so, just copy the ots-template folder (under web-frontend-colearning-metrics/pages/ots-template/),
update index.html with your code.
main.js can be completely sobstitute with your own javascript.
You will need to keep utilities.js as it is and call it in your index.html.
